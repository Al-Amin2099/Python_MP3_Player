# NSBE Workshop: Python MP3 Player
This is a workshop held for NSBE members at UNLV. This workshop was hosted along with 
Serak Gebremedhin (https://github.com/sgebremedhin). This project is an MP3 player written 
in python and the sample song files were taken from youtube using an online mp3 converter.

## Downloading MP3s:
